    <h3>ü•ê A brief history of the croissant - from kipfel to Cronut ü•ê</h3>
    <p>
      One bite of a croissant just pulled from the oven at Michel Lyczak‚Äôs
      bakery in the southern Parisian suburb of Malakoff is bliss: a satisfying
      crunch and scattering of crumbs, the indulgent mouthfeel of butter wrapped
      in the overwhelming sensation of lightness. Few foods are as culturally
      iconic as this flaky breakfast food, so quintessentially French that many
      English speakers defer to its native pronunciation (krwa-sohn). Yet as
      recently as the 19th century, the French viewed the croissant as a foreign
      novelty, sold only in special Viennese bakeries in the pricier parts of
      Paris. And how it came to France in the first place remains obscured by
      layer
